From Udacity's deeplearning lectures.

In windows because virtualbox has limited resources. Full blown ubuntu is better.

To setup in windows:
    Install python(3.6)
    set python and pip on PATH
    download and install anaconda
    use anaconda interpretor environment in PyCharm/PyDev
    scipy is difficult on win 10, needs some extra compiler installation. Can be done, but process is super easy with anaconda
